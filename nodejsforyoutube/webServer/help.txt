Web Server -  To access web pages of any web application, you need a web server. The web server will handle all the http requests for the web application e.g IIS is the web server for ASP.Net and Apache is a web server for PHP
Node.js provides capabilities to create your own web server which will handle HTTP requests asynchronously. you can us IIS or Apache to run Node.js web applicaiton but it is recommended ot use Node.js web server.
